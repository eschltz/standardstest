# Template for Draft Standards and Supplements
<standard name="Name of method">

*<desc>Crisp one-sentence description. Quoting a definition from a seminal paper, with quotation marks and citation, is desirable but not required.</desc>*


## Application 

-   Applies to studies that blah blah blah
-   Does not apply to studies that blah blah blah
-   If study does X then consider standard Y instead
-   The distinguishing feature of a [Name of method] is ...
  
## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes 
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>

- [ ]	Something you expect to see in the introduction or background sections
- [ ]	Leave blank if no specific expectations for this section.
- [ ]	Do not change the section headers or anything else in <these brackets>. 

<method>

- [ ]	lots of things you expect to see in the method section
- [ ]	Don't repeat things from the General Standard
- [ ]	Criteria must be _extremely_ concise and start with a verb. See other standards for examples.

<results>

- [ ]	things you expect in the results or findings section
- [ ]	If you want to include something similar to a criterion in another standard, DO copy-paste. Consistency is our friend. Quotation marks not necessary when copy-pasting from another standard.
- [ ]	try to keep these simple and clear, but you can use an EITHER/OR or "AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING" structure if needed. See other standards for examples.

<discussion>

- [ ]  things you expect to see in the discussion section. 
- [ ] if you want to quote a paper, include a citation like (Smith 2024) and add to suggested readings, OR use a footnote.<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">1</a></sup> 

<other>
  
- [ ] things you expect, but aren't in a specific section
- [ ] for everything listed in Essentail Attributes, you're saying if this is missing, reject the paper. 

</checklist>

### Desirable Attributes 
<checklist name="Desirable">
	
- [ ]	things you'd like to see but you wouldn't reject a paper if they were missing. You can refer to another standard or supplement like this (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md));
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">
  
- [ ]	things where, when you see them, you want to give the paper an award. 
- [ ] stuff that goes above and beyond the call
  
</checklist>

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

- weird edge cases where one of the essential attributes doesn't apply
- try to include at least one such edge case

## Antipatterns 

-   Common problems you observe in papers using this method
-   e.g. Making patently untrue assumptions because the math requires it. 
    
## Invalid Criticisms

-   Things reviews should not say when assessing a paper using this method
-   e.g., in a standard for formal (math-centric) methods, "the paper does not report an empirical study such as an experiments or case study."
	

## Suggested Readings 

Smith, John. 2025. Paper name. *Proceedings of Conference*, Halifax, CA: ACM, Jan. 1-4. (From SE and elsewhere. Stick with the most important and helpful works, including your own if appropriate. Use ACM style.
	
## Exemplars

Smith, John. 2025. Paper name. *Proceedings of Conference*, Halifax, CA: ACM, Jan. 1-4. (Exemplars don't necessarily do everything well so it helps to include a very short note about what aspects of the paper are exemplary.
