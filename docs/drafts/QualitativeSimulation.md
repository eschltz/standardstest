# Qualitative Simulation - DRAFT
<standard name="Qualitative Simulation">

*<desc>A study that involves predominately qualitative analysis of direct observations of humans taking part in a lab-based simulation</desc>*


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following
conditions.

-   Human participants take part in a simulated task, typically in a contrived or lab-based environment, alone or in groups
-   Researchers directly observe (and often record) participants taking part 
-   Observations are analyzed using qualitative coding

Protocol Analysis (AKA protocol studies) are a common type of Qualitative Simulation.

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>


<method>

- [ ]   describes the environment in which the simulation took place
- [ ]   indicates whether partcipants complete the task alone or in groups
- [ ]   describes the events, activities, tasks, or objects comprising the simulations
- [ ]   describes any interference or prompting by the researcher during the simulation, or confirms there was none    
- [ ]   describes the qualitative coding procedures

<results>

- [ ]   presents a clear chain of evidence from observations to findings

<discussion>


<other>    
    
</checklist>
    
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">
    
- [ ]	provides supplemental materials such as task materials, coding schemes, coding examples, decision rules, or extended chain-of-evidence tables
- [ ]   includes debriefing sessions with participants
- [ ]   cross-checks observations against statements made my participants during debriefing sessions
- [ ]   describes how prior understandings of the phenomena were managed and/or influenced the research
- [ ]   EITHER: evaluates an a priori theory (or model, framework, taxonomy, etc.) using deductive coding with an a priori coding scheme based on the prior theory    
     OR: synthesizes results into a new, mature, fully-developed and clearly articulated theory (or model, etc.) using some form of inductive coding (coding scheme generated from data)
- [ ]   includes autoreflection; i.e., researchers reflect on how their own possible biases may have influenced the research
</checklist>
    
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]   uses a team-based approach; e.g., multiple raters with analysis of inter-rater reliability (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md))
- [ ]   published a protocol beforehand and made it publicly accessible (see the [Registered Reports Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/RegisteredReports.md)) 
</checklist>

    
## General Quality Criteria 

As qualitative simulations are more consistent with critical realism, realist quality criteria including ontological appropriateness, contingent validity, trustworthiness, and analytic generalization should be used (see Healy and Perry 2000).  

## Antipatterns 

-  Overstating the degree to which the simulation justifies inferences about participants' cognitive states or cognitive processes. The whole point of a qualitative simulation is often to get insight into cognitive states and processes, but these insights should be presented with caution.
-  Attempting a qualitative simulation from a positivist epistemological stance. There is no coherent positivist basis for qualitative research in an artificial context. Qualitative simulations make more sense from a realist or interpretivist epistemological stance.
-  Describing the study's limitations using quantitative/positivist validity criteria.
                                                                                                                 
## Invalid Criticisms 

-   Does not present quantitative data. That's why it's called a "qualitative" simulation.
-   The task or environment are artificial. The whole point of a qualitative simulation is to study an artificial task in a controlled environment. 
-   Lack of internal validity or objectivity. Those are positivist criteria.
-   Is not reported as a positivist experiment/randomised controlled trial.
