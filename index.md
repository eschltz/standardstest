	<h2>Features of the standards</h2>
	
	<!--
	    - Application (where the standard does and does not apply)
		- Specific Attributes (the properties of a manuscript that make it publishable)
		- General Quality Criteria (qualitative and quantitative quality criteria the paper should meet)
		- Acceptable Deviations (circumstances where the paper may deviate from a standard)
		- Antipatterns (common problems with this methodology that papers should avoid)
		- Invalid criticisms (unreasonable arguments against a paper that reviewers should not make)
		- Suggested Readings (additional scholarship on the method upon which the standard is based)
		- Exemplars (good examples of the method authors should emulate)

			<p>Interactive checklists</p>
			<p>Interactive checklists based on the standards make peer review more specific, technical, and reliable.
			Customized diagnostics help reviewers make more reasonable and actionable suggestions.</p>
